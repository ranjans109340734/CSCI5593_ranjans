    A low power pipelined 16-bit RISC processor is proposed in this paper which mainly consists of ALU, Universal shift register and Barrel Shifter. While a traditional Von Neumann architecture uses a common shared memory for both instruction and data, in this paper a modified Harvard architecture that uses separate memories for its instruction and data memory response is used. It utilizes RISC building design in which 2 cycle operation is using a pipelined outline. The pipelined architecture is used which minimizes the latency and increases the speed and the new innovation with the 2-stage pipelining which works on the positive edge and as well as in the negative edge minimizes the latency and increases the speed and also reduce the stalling in instruction. The clock gating technique is used to minimize the Power. This architecture supports 33 instruction. The instruction cycle consists of 2 stage pipelining and perform fetch, decode, execute, write back operation simultaneously. The control unit Generate signals from the given instructions.
      The initial step in development of the processor a total of 33 instruction/operation is designed. The 2-stage pipelining carries out 4 operations Fetch, Decode, execute & read/write back. In Fetch the data and instruction and are drawn from the memory. whereas in the case of decoder the data which are drawn from the memory are separated activating the three operations ALU, shifter rotator and universal shifter register as per the requirement it may activate, through the clock gating technique saves by reducing the unnecessary switching activities. Most of the operation Instruction fetch, decode, execute and read/write all follows Newmann architecture. But the operations are synchronized to positive and negative clock cycles which lowers a lot of power consumption. 
        A low power design technique called clock gating technique was employed to reduce the power consumption. This method drastically reduces the dynamic power to. 071 w & the quiescent power is reduced to 0.149w total power consumption to 0.220w which is very less than the conventional & also final latency comes out to be 1.5 cycle. Clock gating technique disabling the portion which is not required so the flip flop don't change their state and save the power. This processor can be used for the mathematical computation and other control algorithms.
